# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.

1. What is object destructuring?

  Your answer: It is a method that takes in any number of state objects and allows them to be reffered to by shorthand for the duration of the current method you're in.

  Researched answer: After doing some research I discovered that destructing is a JavaScript feature that allows you to extract multiple pieces of data from an array or object and assign them to their own variables



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event occurs when code allows a user input to update the DOM

  Researched answer: Events that are are the result of user action or a state change within the DOM tree



3. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: A class is a blueprint for which objects are created on

  Researched answer: Looking into it a little more I discovered that a class is a template for objects. A class defines object properties including a valid range of values, and a default value. A class also describes object behavior. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.



4. What is the difference between a HTML div and a span?

  Your answer: I haven't leanred about a span in HTML but a div is a basic container where text can be added and targeted. 

  Researched answer: I searched the internet and found that they are actually pretty similar. According to htmldog.com "The difference between span and div is that a span element is in-line and usually used for a small chunk of HTML inside a line (such as inside a paragraph) whereas a div (division) element is block-line (which is basically equivalent to having a line-break before and after it) and used to group larger chunks of code."



5. What is React.Fragment (or <>) and why would you want to use it?

  Your answer: Honestly not very sure about React.Fragment. I know it used in the render of components and I think it interacts with the html. 

  Researched answer: After looking at the dev.to website I learned that "React fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM because fragments are not rendered to the DOM. So basically we use React.Fragment where we would normally use a wrapper div."



6. What are three options for creating responsive design?

  Your answer: I don't know any specifics off the top of my head but I think that responsive design focuses around fitting the page layout of an app to the paramters of the device being used.

  Researched answer: media queries, boostrap - grid layout, multiple style sheets. 



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week
- Object oriented programming
oop fort short, a programming mindset that places the greatest value on the object/ data rather than logic
- irb
 Interactive Ruby, a way to run Ruby in the terminal
- Instance variable
A variable defined to a class
- Ruby
Interpreted high level language
- Class relationships
Objects/ classes that belong to eachother
- Getter and Setter methods in Ruby
A getter method retrieves the value of an instance variable from an object. A setter method establishes or reestablishes the value for an instance variable.
